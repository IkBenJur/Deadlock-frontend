# Deadlock Frontend

Deadlock is a game where 2 teams of 6 players match against eachother. The match can be won by seiging the enemies base and destroying their praton. 

Each player in the game can select their own hero with different abilities. Throughout the game the players can farm souls by eliminating enemy creeps, eliminating players and destroying objectives.
Using these souls players can buy items to enhance their hero. There are a lot of different items in the game and many more stratagies players can choose to build for.

This app allows players to create builds for hero's and share them with other players. It is also possible to find hero abilities and stats.
